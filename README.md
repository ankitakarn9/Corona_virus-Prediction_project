# Corona Virus Predicting the Trends project

## COVID-19 - One of the greatest Pandemic of all times !

## About COVID-19
The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is the greatest global humanitarian challenge the world has faced since World War II. The pandemic virus has spread widely, and the number of cases is rising daily. The government is working to slow down its spread.

Corona Virus Explained in Simple Terms:

Let's say Raghav got infected yesterday, but he won't know it untill next 14 days
Raghav thinks he is healthy but he is infecting 10 persons per day
Now these 10 persons think they are completely healthy, they travel, go out and infect 100 others
These 100 persons think they are healthy but they have already infected 1000 persons
No one knows who is healthy or who can infect you
All you can do is be responsible, stay in quarentine.


## How it started in India?:

The first COVID-19 case was reported on 30th January 2020 when a student arrived Kerala from Wuhan. Just in next 2 days, Kerela reported 2 more cases. For almost a month, no new cases were reported in India, however, on 2nd March 2020, five new cases of corona virus were reported in Kerala again and since then the cases have been rising affecting 25 states, till now (Bihar and Manipur being the most recent). Here is a brief timeline of the cases in India.
